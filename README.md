# Sales-Report-PowerBI
I created an interactive dashboard using Power BI to visualize sales performance by region, product, and period. The report includes key metrics such as sales volume, YTD, category trends, and profitability analysis by product.

**Objective**

The primary objective was to analyze product performance and sales to determine:

    High-ranking products in terms of sales.
    Differences in performance by country, category, and sales channel.
    The top-performing continent in terms of sales volume.

**Tools and Technologies**

    Dataset: Contoso (realistic simulated business data).
    Power BI: Dashboard creation, dynamic charts, and data modeling.
    DAX: Advanced calculations for rankings, KPIs, and other metrics.

**Key Visualizations**

    Product Ranking: Identified the best-selling products within each category, highlighting revenue drivers.
    Country and Region Analysis: Maps and dynamic tables to visualize sales by country and continent, pinpointing the most impactful markets.
    Category and Sales Channel Analysis: Uncovered the top-performing sales channels, guiding marketing and distribution strategies.
    Interactive Dashboard: Filters by country, category, and year to explore the data from multiple perspectives.

**Key Insights**

    High-Performing Products: Top-selling products are concentrated in [specific categories] and countries like [names].
    Regions with Greatest Impact: [Continent] leads in sales volume, contributing X% to total revenue.
    Preferred Channels: The [channel name] channel outperforms others with X% growth compared to alternatives.

**Potential Impact**

This dashboard enables sales and marketing teams to:

    Identify geographic expansion opportunities.
    Focus efforts on high-profit categories and products.
    Optimize distribution and sales strategies based on the most effective channels.
